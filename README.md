# Job Search

This simple application searches a set of defined websites for key words.
Initially, this script is set up to pull in jobs from `naturalist-dayton.js`,
to search for "Naturalist" jobs in the Dayton Area. This can be easily adapted
by changing the imported js file, and adding your own arrays of jobs and
keywords.

## Running

After running `npm install`, you can run the search by running `npm start`.
That's it!
